I aslo had icons that would also link to seperate sites which took the form as social media icons at the bottom of the page in the footer, which was acompanied with text.

In the middle of the web page (Courses that we offer...) I had text boxes that were orignal meant to transition slighly while hovering over the boxes to give them a tint but them scrap this as i eventual used it on another eleemnt of the page instead but the code for it is still present within my CSS. It detailes the types of courses that are offered to the reader with "begginer", "intermidate" and "expert".

In the About section I had three text boxes that would transition to a darker blue color when hovered over with the cursor to highlight the type of buildings that are used inspecific ares of the UK and makes the text become more visible.

TARGET AUDIANCE:
To best understand the target market for yoga, we ask ourselves – why does someone practice yoga or start practicing yoga? What makes them go and buy a yoga mat and sign up for a yoga class? This classification gives us the following customer segments for the target market for yoga:

-People who want to improve their overall health
-People who want to heal a specific part of the body (eg lower back)
-People who want to reduce the effects of stress and improve mental well-being
-People who are looking for an alternative form of exercise
-People who are trying to lose weight
-People trying to improve their sleep patterns
-People trying to overcome depression or anxiety
-People who are seeking spiritual enlightenment

People practice yoga to improve flexibility, strengthen and tone their muscles and joints, improve their postures, relieve stress and tension from their bodies, and promote relaxation. Having understood this I made sure to have information on my page informing the user of certain techniques to help whilst promoting some of their course that they could undertake.

FEATURES:

-Navigational Bar
Heading each page top, it’s fully responsive and toggles to a neat hamburger menu except the task bar icon that is not currently working on smaller screens. It contains links to the page areas like about and courses for example, which is easy to  fined and user by the user while traversing the page.

-Transitions
Used on images on About us section and used on the buttons on the top of the page when hovered over  by a mouse.

-Videos
used on the Facilties section of the page with controls to play, stop, rewind fastforward and fullscreen.

-Footer
Sat at the bottom is the footer. It’s minimal in style and contains the centralised social media links, opening in separate tabs for a great UX. These  links are dressed in a icon that are easy to see and recognise to there site location.

TESTING:
I whent through all my implemantations of features by once adding them within my code making sure that were running and using tools (chrome dev tools, Gitpod and Wave ect.) and if I ran into an issue that I couldnt solve by myself i resulted to using Youtube and google (also slack) to help me with these problems to see what i had missed. I also used extension on my Gitpod to also help me navigate the fixing process for my icons which I was having a problem with them not appearing as intended so instead I created a script at the bottom of my code and placed my source link to refer to which fixed the issue.

I used  The W3C CSS Validation Service to check the current state of my CSS and it passed with flying colors with nocurrent CSS issues detected with my final buil of code.

After changing these errors and adding alt values I was left with these errors left to fix

"This was the script used for thee icons" https://kit.fontawesome.com/25fb3548cd.js

-ERROS: had an issue with git add and git commit were changes were not being save to github. this was resloved by giving github permision to acsess but when putting in the request to the termilnal "resolve git issue" it came out as "riesolve getit ile issue" however the github is now working as desired. I also had developed a sliding bar that would only show on smaller screens howevre i did not mange to make it functional. I also had a side bar that would appear on samller screens that couldbe opened when on a smaller screen that could be opened with icons, however i never got the side bar to apper when the icons were clicked on as i didnt have enough time to fix this issue.

-REFFRENCES: I  used Easy Tutorials on YouTube to help me structure my website and to have the right values for example images, padding and alligning text.
