# Portfolio Project 1 - HTML/CSS Essentials
-Errors: had an issue with git add and git commit were changes were not being save to github. this was resloved by giving github permision to acsess but when putting in the request to the termilnal "resolve git issue" it came out as "riesolve getit ile issue" however the github is now working as desired. I also had developed a sliding bar that would only show on smaller screens howevre i did not mange to make it functional.

-Reffrences: I  used Easy Tutorials on YouTube to help me structure my website and to have the right values for example images, padding and alligning text.
